# Neuro-Fit Landing Page

A modern, interactive single-page landing page for Neuro-Fit - a revolutionary neurostimulation technology platform that activates dormant muscle fibers and optimizes workout performance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Neuro-Fit is a cutting-edge landing page designed to showcase neurostimulation technology for fitness and muscle activation. The page features interactive visualizations, real-time calculations, and dynamic animations that demonstrate the power of neural activation patterns in fitness training.

The landing page presents a sleek, futuristic design with a dark theme, featuring:
- Interactive muscle group activation visualizations
- Workout optimization calculator
- Real-time neural pattern animations
- Responsive design for all devices

## ✨ Features

### Interactive Muscle Activation
- **Muscle Group Selector**: Choose from 6 different muscle groups (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamic activation zones and neural pattern displays
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time display of activation level, neural frequency, and fiber recruitment percentages
- **Animated Neural Networks**: SVG-based neural network visualizations with pulsing animations

### Workout Optimization Calculator
- **Personalized Calculations**: Input-based optimization for:
  - Body weight (40-200 kg)
  - Workout type (Strength, Endurance, Hypertrophy, Power)
  - Training experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Target muscle group
- **Comprehensive Results**: Calculates and displays:
  - Stimulation frequency (Hz)
  - Pulse duration (μs)
  - Intensity level (%)
  - Session duration (minutes)
  - Expected activation (%)
  - Performance boost (%)

### Visual Features
- **Animated Hero Section**: Pulsing neural network visualization with animated connections
- **Feature Cards**: Three key features with hover effects and icon animations
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Seamless navigation between sections
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

### Design Elements
- **Modern UI/UX**: Dark theme with neural blue, energy yellow, and muscle red color scheme
- **Scientific Aesthetics**: Grid overlays, scan line effects, and glitch animations
- **Custom Animations**: CSS keyframe animations for neurons, connections, and activation zones
- **SVG Graphics**: Custom logo and icons created with SVG

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server or build tools required (static site)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download** the project files to your local machine

2. **Open the Project**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local development server for better experience:
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (with http-server)
     npx http-server
     
     # Using PHP
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Access the Site**
   - If opened directly: `file:///path/to/Neuro-Fit/index.html`
   - If using a server: `http://localhost:8000`

### Development

No build process or dependencies are required. The project uses:
- Bootstrap via CDN (no installation needed)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no npm packages)
- Pure CSS (no preprocessors)

Simply edit the files directly:
- Modify `index.html` for structure changes
- Update `styles.css` for styling changes
- Edit `script.js` for functionality changes
